# Autoreport v1.1.0
#### Build and automate reports with no coding knowledge required!

AutoReport is a report automation software that allows you to escape the tedium of creating Word reports in the Microsoft corporate world, without having any coding knowledge. Automating a report is simple and done in two steps: creating a blank skeleton template for the report, and then define where the data comes from. And it's all done in Excel, no extra tools required.

To use AutoReport, download the current release [here](https://github.com/trevor-pope/AutoReport/releases/tag/1.1.0) and test it out using the samples. 

If you'd like to contribute or modify the source code, you can clone the repo, and download the requirements using ```pip install requirements.txt```, then compile a list of files to install via ```python build_helper.py```, and then finally ```build_exe.bat``` in the command prompt. This creates an NSIS installer script which may be compiled into an installer using [NSIS](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download).
